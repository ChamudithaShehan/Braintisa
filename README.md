## Data Management

Content is managed through structured TypeScript modules in `src/data/`:

- **projectsData.ts** – Portfolio projects with technology stacks and links
- **teamData.ts** – Team member information, skills, and portfolios

This architecture enables easy content updates without modifying component logic. See `src/data/README.md` for detailed schema documentation.
