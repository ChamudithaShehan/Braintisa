## README Screenshots

Add visual previews of each major page directly in this README by following the conventions below. Using relative paths keeps the images working on GitHub and in local clones.

1. Export page screenshots (PNG/JPG/WebP) and save them in `docs/readme-images/`.
2. Use the suggested filenames so the existing Markdown snippets continue to work if you regenerate assets.
3. Commit the images together with README updates so they render correctly on GitHub.

| Page Section      | Suggested Filename              | Markdown Snippet |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Home Page         | `home-page.png`                 | `![Home Page](docs/readme-images/home-page.png)` |
| Our Services Page | `our-services-page.png`         | `![Our Services](docs/readme-images/our-services-page.png)` |
| Our Projects Page | `our-projects-page.png`         | `![Our Projects](docs/readme-images/our-projects-page.png)` |
| Team Page         | `team-page.png`                 | `![Team Page](docs/readme-images/team-page.png)` |
| Get in Touch Page | `get-in-touch-page.png`         | `![Get in Touch](docs/readme-images/get-in-touch-page.png)` |

For example, to embed the home page preview:

```markdown
![Home Page](docs/readme-images/home-page.png)
```

Repeat the same pattern for the remaining sections, replacing the filename and alt text as needed.

### Home Page

![Home Page](docs/readme-images/home-page.png)

### Our Services Page

![Our Services](docs/readme-images/our-services-page.png)

### Our Projects Page

![Our Projects](docs/readme-images/our-projects-page.png)

### Team Page

### Get in Touch Page

## Key Components & Pages

- **Navbar:** Glass-effect fixed header with responsive navigation and theme toggle.
- **Hero:** Animated hero section with smooth scroll buttons (`Get Started` → About, `View Our Work` → Projects).
- **About/Services/Projects/Team/Testimonials:** Section components rendering data-driven cards and grids with staggered animations.
- **Contact:** Two-column layout combining contact details with a validated form and toast confirmation.
- **Footer:** Multi-column footer with social links and an animated scroll-to-top button that appears after scrolling 300px.
- **Pages:** `pages/Index.tsx` orchestrates the landing page sections; `pages/NotFound.tsx` provides a fallback route.

## Data Modules

Located under `src/data/`, each file exports typed content arrays/objects consumed by the UI:

- `companyData.ts`: Company profile, stats, contact info, business hours.
- `servicesData.ts`: Service offerings with feature lists.
- `projectsData.ts`: Portfolio projects with tech stacks and external links.
- `teamData.ts`: Team member bios, skills, and portfolio URLs.
- `testimonialsData.ts`: Client testimonials with ratings and avatars.

The accompanying `README.md` in the data folder documents the structure of each dataset for future updates.

## Styling & Theming

- Tailwind CSS configured in `tailwind.config.ts` with custom colors, gradients, and animation utilities.
- `index.css` and `App.css` define global resets, custom classes (e.g., `glass-effect`, gradient helpers), and keyframe animations.
- `ThemeProvider` wraps the app to persist user-selected light/dark themes using `next-themes`.
- shadcn/ui primitives (e.g., `Button`, `Input`, `Tooltip`) provide consistent styling across the app.

## Animations & Interactions

- Section cards use Tailwind animations (`animate-fade-in-up`, `animate-scale-in`) for entrance effects.
- Buttons include hover transforms for subtle motion.
- Hero CTA buttons trigger smooth scrolling to target sections.
- Footer hosts a scroll-to-top button with fade/slide transitions and hover bounce animation.

## Notifications

- `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` implements a custom toast manager with capped queues and dismiss timers.
- Toasts are surfaced via shadcn/ui `Toaster` and Sonner-based notifications configured in `App.tsx`.

## Testing & Linting

While no automated tests are included by default, ESLint is configured for both React and TypeScript best practices. Extend with `vitest` or other tools as needed.

## Deployment

The project builds to static assets via `npm run build`, producing an optimized bundle suitable for static hosting providers (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) or integration into a larger deployment pipeline.

No explicit license is provided. Add licensing information here if needed before distribution.
